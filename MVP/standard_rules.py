# Allows rules to be extracted with tests passimg. Starting board 
# is taken from rule set, then gameplay happens in that instance of board inside
# the ChessBoard instance. 
# Moves are checked against the current board by the ruleset, against its 
# stored rules. A bit of back and forth between ChessBoard and RuleSet, but clearly
#Â preferable to the game taking place within the ruleset object.
